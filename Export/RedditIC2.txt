[IC] Function (Prototype Run) - Split-Space 96%


Hello Reddit!

This is an update to yesterday's Reddit thread, which gained way more traction and support than I expected. I have a new account because I don't want my old one flooded with messages and such.

**This is an [official IC](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemVlDtGVddiqdZIPw61eYTpooKTykShmgZui4TNtBp6qOkdQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) for the [Function \(Prototype\)](https://imgur.com/gallery/UCJJ7AR)!** Link to album is hyperlinked.

Since yesterday, 2 things have happened:

1. I placed an order for 5 assembled PCB's that should be coming within 2 weeks.
2. I received tentative machining quotes from a few shops.

What does this mean? I have tentative max pricing!

**[Pricing]**

**Maximum** Price currently for an entire Function Keyboard (as-is, no metal finishing atm, no shipping included) **is 500$ (negotiations on-going for lower prices)**

Let me breakdown the pricing:

1. PCB ~ 20$ (it was 80$ for 5). This price will get better depending on how many are ordered, so it will only go down from here.
2. Case ~ 430$ (if only 5 produced). For a one-off unit, the cost is 750$ due to Initial Setup, Fixtures, Machining Time, and Materials. Every additional unit is 350$. Thus as more units get produced, the lower the cost of the case. I'm currently talking to other machine shops for other quotes to hopefully move the price to below 350 per unit, but we'll see.
3. Miscellaneous ~ 50$. I need to assemble a few parts on the PCB, buy USB-C receptacles, buy buttons, buy screws, and program the keyboards to be compatible for QMK. Think of this as labor fees I suppose?

I'm not looking to make money off this endeavor (I'll be down the cost of the keyboard as well), and I'd be more than happy to email my receipts and emails with machine shops to prove my pricing.

I know the price is high, but that's what happens with small-production runs. I personally budgeted 500$ for this keyboard myself, so you know that my wallet is going to hurt just as much as yours.

Now, I'm looking to sell at least 4 keyboards for now, and depending on the response to this IC, I'll increase my order count.

This is the [IC Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemVlDtGVddiqdZIPw61eYTpooKTykShmgZui4TNtBp6qOkdQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)!

Please answer the last question about whether you are willing to invest in one of these keyboards only if you're 96% sure you are going to commit to that, because that affects my negotiations for better pricing. **FOR NON-CALI RESIDENTS WITHIN THE USA or CANADA**, fill the form out too. I'll be willing to ship, but you're going to have to cover the shipping costs.

**[About the Design]**
[Link to first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/hwkolq/ic_checking_interest_for_a_small_prototype_run_of/)

* The Function is a Split-Space 96%. This is a design I've wanted for a very long time but could never find, and thus why I'm creating it.
* The blocky design is by choice. This is called Function, and my next project (if this goes through) will be called Form. 
* This board will support USB-C and be QMK compatible.
* This board is a top mount board with additional space for o-rings if you choose to use them.
* Currently I have no solid plans to finish the metal, so it'd be shipping in raw aluminum form. I'm entertaining the possibility of anodization by a source that Norbauer recommended, but that may be a per-unit choice. TBD

**[My Hopeful Timeline]**

1. Receive the PCB's within 2 weeks and verify that I can get them moving. Nothing progresses unless I can make the PCB's work, and with QMK.
2. Once PCB's are functional, I will send an email update to everyone responding to this [IC] with a [GB] form.
3. I will begin sending out requests for case and plate production. I don't know what the time-frame will be like, but 1 month maximum hopefully? This is under the assumption I don't make more than 10. This might seem fast, but I think the fact I'll be manufacturing locally helps compared to a traditional [GB]

Thanks for reading this post! I hope to see all of your responses to the IC Form soon.

I'll be answering questions in the comments or feel free to email me at JTMkeebdesign@gmail.com
